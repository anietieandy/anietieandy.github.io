I am a Postdoctoral Reasearch Fellow at the Department of Computer and Information Science, University of Pennsylvania, working with Chris Callison-Burch.

Over time, human knowledge has mostly been expressed in text, some of which are unstructured.
To make sense of these knowledge and understand the nuances of human language, computers
have to be able to extract structured knowledge from unstructured text. In certain languages,
semantically similar sentences could be worded differently and words are sometimes ambiguous,
hence the specifc sense of a word intended in a sentence is determined by the context in which an
instance of the ambiguous word appears. 

My research interest focuses on applying machine learning to better understand the various ways
in which words, phrases, and sentences are expressed.
